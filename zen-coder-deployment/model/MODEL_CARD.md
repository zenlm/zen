# Model Card: zen-coder

## Model Details

### Model Description
Zen-Coder is a specialized variant of zen-omni-thinking, fine-tuned for advanced code generation through learning from real git histories and development patterns. The model understands the temporal evolution of codebases, learning from refactoring patterns, bug fixes, and iterative development cycles.

**Developed by:** Hanzo AI Research
**Model type:** Code Generation Model with Multimodal Understanding
**Language(s):** TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Solidity, Python, Rust, and 20+ programming languages
**Base model:** zenlm/zen-omni-thinking
**License:** Apache 2.0
**Model size:** 70B parameters
**Context length:** 128K tokens

## Uses

### Direct Use
- Code generation from natural language descriptions
- Code completion and suggestion
- Code refactoring and optimization
- Bug fixing and error correction
- Code translation between languages
- Code generation from visual inputs (screenshots, diagrams)

### Downstream Use
- IDE integration for intelligent code assistance
- Automated code review systems
- Documentation generation
- Test case generation
- API client generation from specifications

### Out-of-Scope Use
- Generating malicious code or exploits
- Bypassing security measures
- Creating code without proper testing
- Replacing human code review entirely

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Biases
- **Ecosystem Bias:** Strong preference for Hanzo/Zoo/Lux coding patterns
- **Language Bias:** Better performance on TypeScript, Go, and Solidity
- **Style Bias:** Tends toward specific architectural patterns from training data

### Risks
- May memorize and reproduce proprietary code patterns
- Could generate insecure code if not properly validated
- May perpetuate anti-patterns present in training data

### Limitations
- Best performance on ecosystems similar to training data
- May struggle with highly domain-specific code outside training distribution
- Requires validation for production use

### Recommendations
Users should:
- Always review and test generated code
- Run security audits on generated code
- Validate against project-specific requirements
- Use in conjunction with existing CI/CD pipelines
