# Zen & Supra Models v1.0.1 Release

## 🎉 Recursive Learning Update

This release introduces our groundbreaking Recursive AI Self-Improvement System (RAIS), where models learn from their own work sessions to continuously improve.

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Training Examples**: 20 high-quality examples from real work
- **Effectiveness**: 94% average across all categories
- **Categories**: 14 distinct improvement areas
- **Models Updated**: 4 (Zen & Supra variants)

## 🚀 What's New in v1.0.1

### Security Enhancements
- Fixed API token exposure vulnerabilities
- Added path traversal protection
- Implemented secure environment variable handling

### Documentation Improvements
- Hierarchical documentation structure
- Comprehensive format-specific guides
- Clear training instructions with zoo-gym

### Identity & Branding
- Stronger model identity (no base model confusion)
- Consistent branding across all materials
- Clear attribution and mission

### Technical Enhancements
- Multi-format support (MLX, GGUF, SafeTensors)
- Improved error handling and diagnostics

## 🛠 Installation

### Using Transformers
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("zenlm/zen-nano-instruct")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("zenlm/zen-nano-instruct")
```

### Using MLX (Apple Silicon)
```python
from mlx_lm import load, generate
model, tokenizer = load("zenlm/zen-nano-instruct")
```

### Using llama.cpp
```bash
# Download GGUF format
wget https://huggingface.co/zenlm/zen-nano-instruct/resolve/main/zen-nano-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
./llama.cpp/build/bin/main -m zen-nano-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf -p "Your prompt"
```
