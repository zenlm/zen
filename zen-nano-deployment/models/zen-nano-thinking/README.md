# Zen-Nano-Thinking

## Model Details

### Model Description

Zen-Nano-Thinking is a 4B parameter language model with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. It uses special `<think>` tokens to generate intermediate reasoning steps before providing final answers, achieving 72B-class performance on complex reasoning tasks. This variant excels at mathematical problem-solving, logical reasoning, and multi-step planning.

## Training Details

### Training Data

Base training plus specialized reasoning data:

- 20B tokens of step-by-step solutions
- 15B tokens of debugging traces
- 10B tokens of planning scenarios

### Training Procedure

**Stage 1:** Standard pre-training (same as zen-nano-instruct)

**Stage 2:** Thinking-specific fine-tuning
- Custom loss for thinking token generation
- Reward modeling for reasoning quality
- Process supervision for intermediate steps
- Verification training for self-correction

### Architecture

Identical to zen-nano-instruct with additions:
- Special tokens: `<think>`, `</think>`
- Modified attention mask for thinking sequences
- Separate loss computation for thinking vs output

## Environmental Impact

- **Additional Training:** 7 days on 32x A100 GPUs
- **Carbon Footprint:** +4.1 tons CO2eq (on top of base)
- **Efficiency Note:** Thinking adds compute but improves accuracy

## How to Use

### Installation

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Basic Usage with Thinking

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

# Load model
model_name = "zenlm/zen-nano-thinking"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto"
)

# Complex problem requiring reasoning
prompt = """User: A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die.
How many sheep are left?"""

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_length=1024,
    temperature=0.7,
    do_sample=True,
    top_p=0.9
)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=False)
print(response)
```

### Expected Output Format

```
User: A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die. How many sheep are left?
<think>
This is a bit of a trick question. Let me think carefully.
"All but 9 die" means that 9 sheep survive.
So if all except 9 die, then 9 sheep are left alive.
The initial number of 17 is meant to confuse.
</think>
Assistant: 9 sheep are left. The phrase "all but 9 die" means that 9 sheep survived.
```

### Controlling Thinking Behavior

```python
# Force thinking for simple queries
prompt = "User: What is 2+2? (Please show your thinking)"

# Skip thinking for direct answers
prompt = "User: What is the capital of France? (Direct answer only)"

# Custom thinking depth
generation_config = {
    "max_thinking_length": 500,  # Limit thinking tokens
    "min_thinking_length": 50,   # Ensure some thinking
    "temperature": 0.3,          # Lower temp for reasoning
}
```

### Parsing Thinking Output

```python
def parse_response(text):
    """Extract thinking and final response"""
    import re

    thinking_pattern = r'<think>(.*?)</think>'
    thinking_match = re.search(thinking_pattern, text, re.DOTALL)

    thinking = thinking_match.group(1).strip() if thinking_match else None

    # Remove thinking from response
    final_response = re.sub(thinking_pattern, '', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    final_response = final_response.split("Assistant:")[-1].strip()

    return {
        "thinking": thinking,
        "response": final_response
    }

# Example usage
result = parse_response(generated_text)
print("Thinking:", result["thinking"])
print("Final Answer:", result["response"])
```

### Advanced: Streaming with Thinking

```python
from transformers import TextStreamer

class ThinkingStreamer(TextStreamer):
    """Custom streamer that handles thinking tokens"""

    def __init__(self, tokenizer, skip_thinking=False):
        super().__init__(tokenizer, skip_special_tokens=False)
        self.in_thinking = False
        self.skip_thinking = skip_thinking

    def on_finalized_text(self, text, stream_end=False):
        if "<think>" in text:
            self.in_thinking = True
        if "</think>" in text:
            self.in_thinking = False
            return  # Don't print the closing tag

        if not self.in_thinking or not self.skip_thinking:
            print(text, end="", flush=True)

# Stream with thinking visible
streamer = ThinkingStreamer(tokenizer, skip_thinking=False)
model.generate(**inputs, streamer=streamer)

# Stream without showing thinking
streamer = ThinkingStreamer(tokenizer, skip_thinking=True)
model.generate(**inputs, streamer=streamer)
```

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Complex Problems**: Let the model think naturally
   ```
   User: Solve this step by step: If a train travels...
   ```

2. **Simple Queries**: Request direct answers
   ```
   User: What is 5+5? (direct answer)
   ```

3. **Debugging**: Ask for reasoning process
   ```
   User: Debug this code and explain your reasoning...
   ```

4. **Learning**: Request teaching mode
   ```
   User: Teach me how to solve quadratic equations...
   ```

### Thinking Triggers

The model automatically activates thinking for:
- Mathematical word problems
- Logic puzzles
- Code debugging
- Multi-step instructions
- "Explain your reasoning" requests
- "Think step by step" prompts
