- **Stage 4**: Maximum performance (60s download, 100% quality)

### 2. BitDelta Personalization
Ultra-efficient user adaptation:
- 1-bit weight deltas (600KB per user vs 30GB)
- 0.3ms switching latency
- 123,000 concurrent users per H100 GPU
- 92.7% quality retention

### 3. Spatial-Temporal Processing
Advanced multimodal understanding:
- Language-Aligned Positional Embedding (LAPE)
- Spatial-Temporal Packer (STP) 
- Multi-view 3D understanding
- Real-time streaming generation

## Development Workflow

### Training Pipeline
```bash
# Generate training data from git history
cd ~/work/zen/zen-coder
python git_training_generator.py

# Fine-tune model
cd ~/work/zen/zen-omni
python finetune_zen_omni.py

# Deploy with progressive loading
python progressive_llm.py
```

### Model Conversion
```bash
# Convert to GGUF for llama.cpp
python convert_to_gguf.py

# Export to Ollama
python export_to_ollama.py

# Push to Hugging Face
python push_to_hf.py
```
