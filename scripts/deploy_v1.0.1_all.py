## v1.0.1 Improvements (Recursive Learning Release)

### ðŸ”’ Security Enhancements
- Fixed API token exposure vulnerabilities
- Added path traversal protection
- Implemented secure environment variable handling

### ðŸ“š Documentation Improvements  
- Hierarchical documentation structure
- Comprehensive format-specific guides
- Clear training instructions with zoo-gym

### ðŸŽ¯ Identity & Branding
- Stronger model identity (no base model confusion)
- Consistent branding across all materials
- Clear attribution and mission

### ðŸ”§ Technical Enhancements
- Multi-format support (MLX, GGUF, SafeTensors)
- Improved error handling and diagnostics
- Better training data from work sessions

### ðŸ§¬ Recursive Learning
- Learned from 20 real work interactions
- Pattern recognition and improvement synthesis
- Self-improving architecture foundation

## Training Data

This version was trained on synthetic data generated from actual work sessions,
implementing a recursive self-improvement approach where the AI learns from its
own problem-solving experiences.

## Usage

```python
# For inference
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("{model['repo']}")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("{model['repo']}")

# MLX (Apple Silicon)
from mlx_lm import load, generate
model, tokenizer = load("{model['repo']}")
```
