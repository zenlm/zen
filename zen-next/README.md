## Current Experiments

### Experiment 1: Infinite Context
```python
from zen_next import InfiniteContext

model = InfiniteContext(
    base_model="zen-next-base",
    streaming_window=4096,
    compression_ratio=10,
    memory_layers=16
)

# Process unlimited context
result = model.process(
    context=entire_codebase,  # 1M+ tokens
    query="Find all security vulnerabilities"
)
```

### Experiment 2: Consciousness Attention
```python
from zen_next import ConsciousAttention

model = ConsciousAttention(
    self_awareness_layers=8,
    metacognition_depth=3,
    introspection_weight=0.3
)

# Self-aware processing
thought = model.think(
    "What am I doing wrong in this reasoning?",
    reflect=True
)
```

### Experiment 3: Quantum-Classical Hybrid
```python
from zen_next import QuantumHybrid

model = QuantumHybrid(
    classical_layers=24,
    quantum_layers=4,
    entanglement_degree=0.7
)

# Leverage quantum advantage
result = model.quantum_solve(
    problem="traveling_salesman",
    cities=1000
)
```

### Experiment 4: Swarm Intelligence
```python
from zen_next import SwarmModel

swarm = SwarmModel(
    agents=100,
    consensus_mechanism="byzantine",
    communication_topology="small_world"
)

# Distributed problem solving
solution = swarm.collective_solve(
    problem=complex_optimization,
    iterations=1000
)
```

## Architecture Innovations

### Mixture of Depths (MoD)
```python
# Dynamic depth allocation
model = ZenNext(
    architecture="MoD",
    max_depth=100,
    adaptive_routing=True
)

# Easy problems use few layers
# Hard problems use many layers
result = model.adaptive_forward(input)
print(f"Used {result.layers_used} layers")
```

### Continuous Learning
```python
# Never stop learning
model = ZenNext(continuous_learning={
    "experience_replay": True,
    "elastic_weights": True,
    "memory_consolidation": "sleep",
    "forgetting_rate": 0.01
})

# Learn from every interaction
model.learn_from_feedback(
    interaction=conversation,
    reward=user_satisfaction
)
```

### Neural Architecture Search
```python
# Evolve optimal architecture
from zen_next import NAS

evolved_model = NAS.evolve(
    population_size=100,
    generations=50,
    fitness_function=lambda m: m.quality / m.latency,
    constraints={
        "max_params": "100B",
        "max_latency": "20ms",
        "min_quality": 0.95
    }
)
```
