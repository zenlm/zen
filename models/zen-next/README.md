# Zen-Next

## Model Description

Zen-Next is the experimental preview of next-generation Zen capabilities, featuring advanced architectural improvements and novel training techniques that will define Zen2.

## Experimental Features

- **Adaptive compute**: Dynamic parameter activation based on query complexity
- **Memory consolidation**: Long-term knowledge retention across sessions
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Native support for agent swarms
- **Neural architecture search**: Self-optimizing model structure
- **Quantum-inspired attention**: Novel attention mechanisms

## What's New

### Adaptive Intelligence
- Automatically scales compute from 1B to 4B parameters
- Query complexity detection
- Resource-aware processing
- Energy-efficient inference

### Enhanced Reasoning
- Recursive self-improvement
- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Causal reasoning chains
- Counterfactual analysis

### Agent Capabilities
- Tool creation and modification
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Autonomous goal setting
- Self-directed learning

## Architecture Innovations

```
Query → [Complexity Analyzer] → [Compute Allocator]
                              ↓
        [Adaptive MoE Layer] → [Memory Bank]
                              ↓
        [Meta-Learning Module] → Output
```

## Model Details

- **Parameters**: 4B (1B-4B adaptive)
- **Context**: 64K tokens (expandable to 256K)
- **Memory**: Persistent 10M token memory bank
- **Training**: Meta-learning + RLHF + Constitutional AI

## Usage

### Standard Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("zenlm/zen-next")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("zenlm/zen-next")

# Automatically adapts compute
response = model.generate(
    tokenizer("Simple question", return_tensors="pt").input_ids,
    adaptive_compute=True  # Uses ~1B params
)

response = model.generate(
    tokenizer("Complex reasoning task", return_tensors="pt").input_ids,
    adaptive_compute=True  # Uses ~4B params
)
```

### Memory-Enhanced Sessions

```python
from zen1_next import MemoryModel

model = MemoryModel("zenlm/zen-next")

# First session
model.chat("My name is Alice and I work on quantum computing")

# Later session (remembers context)
model.chat("What field do I work in?")  # Knows you're Alice in quantum
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```python
from zen1_next import AgentSwarm

swarm = AgentSwarm("zenlm/zen-next", num_agents=3)
result = swarm.solve(
    "Design a distributed system for real-time AI inference",
    agents=[
        {"role": "architect", "focus": "system design"},
        {"role": "engineer", "focus": "implementation"},
        {"role": "reviewer", "focus": "optimization"}
    ]
)
```

## Experimental Capabilities

### Self-Improvement

```python
# Model can improve its own responses
response1 = model.generate(prompt)
response2 = model.self_improve(response1)
# response2 is typically higher quality
```

### Tool Creation

```python
# Model can define new tools
tool_def = model.create_tool(
    "I need a way to analyze time series data for anomalies"
)
# Returns executable tool specification
```
